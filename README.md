# Don't Feed The Trolls
A simple HTML and CSS project developed during my IT Specialist training at Lutz + Grub Academy. This project was my first attempt at building a basic webpage with an image, text, and a link to another page.

The code was written independently by me. The class only provided a general idea of what the project should do.
